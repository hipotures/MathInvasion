# Active Context: Math Invasion

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial)
**Date:** 2025-04-28

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Milestone:** M0 - Szkielet Projektu (Setup)
*   **Current Task:** Completing the initial project setup, including folder structure, tooling (Vite, TS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky), Git initialization, Memory Bank creation, and a basic Phaser "Hello World" scene.
*   **Next Step:** Create the initial "Hello World" Phaser scene and basic PWA files (`manifest.json`, `service-worker.ts`).

## 2. Recent Changes / Decisions

*   Project initialized using Vite (Vanilla TS template).
*   Phaser 3 and js-yaml installed.
*   ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged installed and configured.
*   Basic project directory structure created.
*   Git repository initialized locally.
*   Core Memory Bank files created (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, ...).
*   Plan finalized and saved to `PLAN.md`.

## 3. Key Considerations / Pending Questions

*   Need to create the GitHub repository and link the local repo.
*   Need to establish the exact structure and content for the initial Phaser scene (`main.ts`, `GameScene.ts`).
*   Need to define the initial `manifest.json` and placeholder `service-worker.ts`.

*This context should be updated frequently as work progresses, especially before switching tasks or ending a session.*
